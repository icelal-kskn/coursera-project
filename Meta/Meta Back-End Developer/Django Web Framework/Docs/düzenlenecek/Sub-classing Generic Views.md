Sub-classing Generic Views
In this reading, you’ll learn about the class_based generic views.

You can implement the view layer with function or class-based views in a Django application. You declare a class by extending the django.views.View class and define get() and post() methods inside it to handle the HTTP requests. The URL pattern connects the path to the class with the as_view() method of the View class. 

A quick example of class view:

12345
from django.views import View   
class NewView(View):   
    def get(self, request):   
        # View logic will place here   
        return HttpResponse('response') 
The URL pattern in urls.pyis updated as below:

12345
#urls.py 
from myapp.views import NewView   
urlpatterns = [   
    path('about/', NewView.as_view()),   
]  
Django provides class-based generic views to make the development process much easier and faster. In this reading, you’ll discover how the generic views are implemented.

The most frequently used generic views are:

TemplateView

CreateView 

ListView

DetailView 

UpdateView 

DeleteView

LoginView

Difference between Function View and generic view
Let's take a simple example of rendering a Hello world template. You should render the template as the HTTP response – the return value of the function. The view function for this purpose would be as follows:

123456
from django.shortcuts import render 
from django.http import HttpResponse 
def index(request): 
    template = loader.get_template('myapp/index.html') 
    context={} 
    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request)) 
As you may have already learned, the app package folder exists inside the project's outer container folder. The myapp app is created in the Django project named myproject.

In the myapp/urls.py, define the URL pattern:

1
path('/', views.index, name='index') 
You can include the URL definitions of myapp in the project's URL configuration:

1234
urlpatterns = [ 
    . . . , 
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')) 
]   
Use a TemplateView class instead. Simply define a class extending it and set the template_name attribute.

1234
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView 

class IndexView(TemplateView): 
    template_name = 'index.html' 
The corresponding URL pattern should incorporate this:

1
path('/', IndexView.as_view(), name='index') 
Advantage of function-based views
Simple to implement.

Easy to read.

Explicit code flow.

Straightforward usage of decorators.

good for one-off or specialized functionality.

Disadvantages of function-based views
Hard to extend and reuse the code.

Handling of HTTP methods via conditional branching.

Advantages of Class-based views
Code reusability.

DRY — Using CBVs help to reduce code duplication.

Code can be extended to include more functionalities.

class with different methods for each http request instead of conditional branching statements inside a single function-based view.

Built-in generic class-based views.

Disadvantages of Class-based views
Harder to read.

Implicit code flow.

Use of view decorators require extra import or method override.

Requirements of a generic view
If the view needs a model to be processed, it should be set as the value of model property of the view.

Each type of view looks for a template name with modelname suffixed by the type of generic view. For example, for a list view processing employee model, Django tries to find employee_list.html.

The generic view is mapped with the URL with as_view() method of the View class.

Let's now build a subclass for each of the respective generic view classes to perform CRUD operations on the Employee model:

123456
class Employee(models.Model):   
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)   
    email = models.EmailField()   
    contact = models.CharField(max_length=15)   
    class Meta:   
        db_table = "Employee" 
CreateView
The CreateView class automates the creation of a new instance of the model. To provide a create view, use the sub-class of CreateView:

123456
from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView   

class EmployeeCreate(CreateView):   
    model = Employee    
    fields = '__all__' 
    success_url = "/employees/success/" 
A model form based on the model structure is created by this view and passed to the employeeCreate.html template:

1234567
<form method="post"> 
{% csrf_token %} 
<table> 
    {{ form.as_table }} 
</table> 
    <input type="submit" value="Save"> 
</form> 
The URL path is updated by mapping the "create/" path to the as_view() method of this class:

12345
from .views import EmployeeCreate 
urlpatterns = [ 
    . . . 
    path('create/', EmployeeCreate.as_view(), name = 'EmployeeCreate')  , 
] 
When the client visits this URL, they are presented with the form. The user fills and submits the employee details, which are saved in the Employee table.

ListView
Django's django.views.generic.list module contains the definition of ListView class. Write its sub-class to render the list of model objects.

 The EmployeeList class is similar to the CreateView sub-class except its base class.

1234
from django.views.generic.list import ListView  
class EmployeeList(ListView):   
    model = Employee   
    success_url = "/employees/success/" 
The template required for this view must be named employee_list.html. Django sends the model object in its context. Using the DTL loop syntax, you can display the list of employees:

12345678
<ul>   
        {% for object in object_list %}   
        <li>Name: {{ object.name }}</li>   
        <li>Email: {{ object.email }}</li>   
        <li>contact: {{ object.contact }}</li>  
        <br/> 
        {% endfor %}   
</ul> 
If the user visits 
http://localhost:/8000/employees/list
, the browser lists all the rows in the employee table.

DetailView
The generic DetailView is found in the django.views.generic.detail module. Now, create its sub-class, EmployeeDetail (much the same way as EmployeeList). Note that this view shows the details of an object whose primary key is passed as an argument in the URL. So, add the following path in the app's URL pattern:

1
path('show/<int:pk>', EmployeeDetail.as_view(), name = 'EmployeeDetail') 
Again, the View object fetches the model instance and passes it as a context to the employee_detail.html template, which displays its attributes with template syntax as follows:

1234
<h1>Name : {{object.name}}</h1>   

    <p>Email : {{ object.email }}</p>   
    <p>Contact : {{ object.contact }}</p> 
Assuming the URL visited is /employees/1, the Employee record with primary key=1 will be displayed.

UpdateView
This is another generic view, defined in django.views.generic.edit module. It renders a form in which the new values of the model attributes can be submitted. Set the fields attribute to '__all__' or to a list of updatable fields.

12345
from django.views.generic.edit import UpdateView  
class EmployeeUpdate(UpdateView):   
    model = Employee   
    fields = '__all__'   
    success_url = "/employees/success/" 
Since this view is intended to update the data of a given model instance, its URL path must be configured accordingly:

1
path('update/<int:pk>', EmployeeUpdate.as_view(), name = 'EmployeeUpdate') 
The example URL that invokes this view is /employees/1.

The UpdateView class renders the template with its name having update_formas suffix:

12345678
#employee_update_form.html 
<form method="post"> 
{% csrf_token %} 
<table> 
    {{ form.as_table }} 
</table> 
    <input type="submit" value="Save"> 
</form> 
DeleteView
Lastly, the generic view performs thedelete operation on a model's given instance. It is present when editing the sub-module of django.views.generic module:

1234
from django.views.generic.edit import DeleteView 
class EmployeeDelete(DeleteView):   
    model = Employee   
    success_url = "/employees/success/" 
You need to pass the primary key of the Employee model to this. So, the URL path is set as:

1
path('<delete/int:pk>', EmployeeDelete.as_view(), name = 'EmployeeDelete') 
The employee_confirm_delete.html template asks for confirmation from the user before removing the model instance.

1234567
<form method="post"> 
{% csrf_token %}   

    <p>Are you sure you want to delete "{{ object }}"?</p>   

    <input type="submit" value="Confirm">   
</form> 
In this reading, you got to know about the class-based generic views to perform CRUD operations. Generic views are much easier to write than the function_based view, although both have their own advantages and disadvantages.
